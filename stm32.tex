\chapter{Introduction}
The rapid development of technology lead to the moment, when anybody can afford a development board 
and learn how to program microcontrollers without even leaving house.
Hobbysts all around the world create products in wide range of applications, that can easily compete
with their professional counterparts in both price and quality.

One example of such a field is market of sound related equipment.
More and more small companies are growing out of nowhere,
providing butique studio recording and processing equipment with great customer service and support.




\chapter{Goals and tasks of the project}

while delivering decent sound quality.

        \item choosing IDE, text editor, toolchain and frameworks
        \item writing and testing the program (user interface, effects)
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}




\chapter{Topic analysis}
This chapter is devoted to main concerns related to the project,
that need to be considered at the beginning.
These will determine all important features and parameters of the device.

\section{Data acquisition}
The nature of audio signal is analog. This means,
that it should be conditioned in a proper way before it can be processed by digital circuitry.
It is done by ADC and coresponding preamplifier.

Signal must be reduced from continuous-time to discrete-time.
This process is called sampling and requires reading value of the signal in equal intervals of time.
Range of audible frequencies is considered to be 20Hz to 20kHz
and we need the whole range to acheive reasonable quality.
According to the concept of Nyquist frequency, the sampling frequency should be at least
twice as high as maximum frequency present in the signal.
In case of audio signal, it must be at leasu 40kHz.
There are some typical sampling frequencies preffered for audio signals such as: 44,1kHz, 48kHz,
96kHz, 192kHz and it would be a good idea to use one of them.

Furthermore ADC quantizes the value of the signal.
This means, that signal can take one of finite number of values.
The count of possible values is equal to \(2^n\), where n is the bit depth of the converter.

As stereo signal consists of two separate channels,
there sould be two identical sets of preaplifiers and converters.

\section{Output generation}
Processed digital signal must be converted back to analog.
This is done using DAC and corresponding amplifier.
DAC converts digital value into specific analog voltage,
outputs it and holds the value until succesive sample is to be outputted.

\section{Processing audio}
Digital signals are usually processed in blocks.
This approach allows to use FFT, which is necessary for some effects.
Furthermore it can reduce time needed to process each sample.
One drawback of this method is latency introduced.
The whole block of samples needs to be collected before it can be processed.
In case of blocks consisting of 512 samples,
there is 1024 samples delay between collecting and outputting specific sample.
In combination with 48kHz sampling frequency this results in 21.3 ms latency.
Outputting, processing and collecting subsequent blocks off data
must be performed simultaneously.

\section{Effects}
This section is dedicated to audio effects implemented in the devices
as well as their features and parameters.
It is important to fully understand nature of specific effect
in order to implement it's entire functionality in a proper way.
\cite{Zolzer1}
\cite{Zolzer2}
\cite{Smith}

\subsection{Delay}
Delay is the most basic time based effects.
It creates echo of original signal,
which is delayed by specified amount of time.
This delayed signal is then mixed with original.
Delayed signal can also be attenuated and then fed back into a delay block
in order to achieve endless, fading reflections.

Because processed signal is quantized,
delay time is described by number of samples.
Digital implementation of this effect requires use of circular buffer,
which size is determined by delay time required.
Each sample collected from input is stored in the buffer
in order to be read later and mixed to the output.

\subsection{Modulation}
Modulation effects use LFO to modulate different parameters.
Our attention will be focused on pitch modulation
which is based on delay effect and works by varying a delay time.
Modulation effects usually use short delay times up to 30ms
and LFO frequency up to several Hz.
Different functions, such as sine,
triangular or sawtooth can be used for LFO.
There are a few distinct modulation effects:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Chorus - uses delay time up to 20ms with LFO frequency up to 10Hz with medium depth.
    \item Flanger - simmilar to chorus, but uses shorter delay time and higher value of depth.
        Flanger effects also use feedback.
    \item Vibrato - is a different type of pitch modulation effect. It mutes original (dry) signal
        from the mix, leaving only modulated sound.
    \item Tremolo - in contrast to previous effects uses volume modulation instead of pitch modulation.
    \item Phaser - modulates phase of the signal. It is done with use of all-pass filters.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Biquad filter}
Biquad (biquadratic) filter is a type of second order IIR digital filter.
The biquad filter is desctibed by 5 coefficients and exists in two direct forms.
The difference between them is that the direct form 1 uses four delay registers
while direct form 2 requires only two.
This is the reason why direct form 2 is considered to be canonical.
Use of proper formulas allows to implement biquad as one of many types of filters
including high-pass, low-pass, band-pass, peak, notch, high-shelf and low-shelf.
Filters are also described by parameters such as corner frequency, quality factor
and in some cases preak gain.
\cite{Biquad}
\cite{biquad_web}

\subsection{Drive}
Non-linear effects, such as overdrive, distortion or fuzz,
introduce higher harmonic frequencies into processed signal by clipping.
It is done by passing input signal through a non-linear clipping function.
This kind of effects are often used by guitarists,
especially these playing in rock and metal bands.

\section{Display}
There are different ways to connect LCD to a microcontroller.
The most common is use of a parallel interface,
such as Intel 8080, Motorola 6800 or RGB interface.
These solutions require 8, 16 or 24 data lines,
alongside few other control signals.
Other approach involves use of serial interface,
such as SPI or I\(^2\)C.
It allows to reduce number of connections necessary to control the display,
at cost of greatly decreased data transfer rate.

With connection between MCU and LCD established,
we can focus our attention on actually sending data to be displayed.
Common approach, seen in TV and computer monitors,
is to constantly refresh the screen pixel by pixel.
It involves sending huge amounts of data,
even if displayed picture does not change.
Since most of LCD units designed to be used with microcontrollers
contain their own controller as well as RAM,
constant refreshing is completely unnecessary.
Instead, controller allows selecting a rectangular portion
of screen, which is ment to be updated.
This way we can eliminate problem of wasting MCU performance
on resending the same data over and over.

Some vendors provide drivers for their displays.
Unfortunately they are usually implemented for Arduino
and use so called polling mode,
which blocks MCU for the time of data transfer.
It means that custom driver must be created for this project.


\chapter{External specification}

\section{Block diagram}

\section{Desctiption}
Device was designed in a form of a “shield” for NUCLEO development board.
The NUCLEO board provides a ST-Link programmer/debugger
and voltage regulators required to power the board from 5V USB.
The shield is populated with analog and digital parts
as well as two audio jacks for analog input and output.
Separate power lines and ground planes are used for digital and analog supply.

Device relays on both onboard digital to analog
and analog to digital converters present in the microcontroller,
so external preamplifiers are the only thing needed on the audio path.
Input preamplifier consist of two stages.
First stage acts as a buffer and provides about 14.5dB boost.
Boost is added to improve performance of converters.
At this point DC offset is added, because unipolar voltage supply was used.
The second stage is a basic phase inverter with unity gain.
Outputs of both stages are fed into differential inputs of ADC
and are sampled by microcontroller.

Output preamplifier consist of single inverting operational amplifier.
It provides -20dB attenuation necessary to achieve line level on output.
After output stage there is a 1.5Hz high-pass filter,
whose task is to eliminate DC offset.
Both input and output preamplifiers are stereo and introduce 20kHz low-pass filter
to prevent aliasing and noise.
All 3 operational amplifiers are decoupled using a 100nF capacitor.

TFT LCD is used to provide necessary information to the user.
It is connected to the board using gold pin headers and sockets.
Display communicates with microcontroller through full duplex SPI connection.

To allow user to interact with the device, a rotary encoder was introduced.
It is connected to microcontroller and is handled by internal timer.
Push button of the encoder and additional user button are connected
to GPIOs of the microcontroller with external pull-up resistors.

Additionally the board is equipped with 32MB SDRAM chip
(of which only 16MB is accessible).
It is not used by the program of this project, but allows for future improvements.
SDRAM is handled by FMC present in the microcontroller.

\section{Choice of components}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Microcontroller
    
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{images/lqfp}
        \caption{LQFP144 microcontroller package}
        \label{fig:LQFP}
    \end{figure}

    The microcontroller should meet certain parameters to be chosen.
    One of the most important parameters is the clock speed.
    Digital signal processing requires a lot of processor instructions
    per each audio sample, so high clock speed is preferred.

    The second important criterion is amount of memory.
    The microcontroller should have at least 128kB of ROM
    to fit the written program.
    Size of RAM should be as high as possible,
    because delay effects require a lot of memory.

    Presence of FPU is preferred due to its performance benefits.
    Dedicated floating-point hardware greatly decreases time
    needed for floating-point calculations.

    To reduce the total cost of the device,
    proper A/D and D/A converters could be included in the microcontroller.

    All of above criterion is met by STM32H743ZI microcontroller.
    It is based on Arm Cortex-M7 32-bit RISC core.
    This specific model uses LQFP144 package.
    Most important parameters of this microcontroller are listed below:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 480MHz maximum clock frequency
        \item 1MB of RAM and 2MB of Flash memory
        \item single and double precision FPU and set of DPS instructions
        \item 16-bit ADC and 12-bit DAC
        \item 140 I/Os and selection of peripherals such as hardware
        SPI, I2C, I2S, UART, SPDIF, USB OTG
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/Nucleo}
        \caption{Nucleo H7 development board}
        \label{fig:Nucleo}
    \end{figure}

    The STM32H743ZI comes one the NUCLEO-H743ZI evaluation board.
    It includes ST-LINK debugger/programmer,
    which simplified development of the device. 


    \item Operational amplifiers

    TLC272C was operational amplifier of choice.
    It contains two amplifiers in a single SMD package, which is SOIC-8.
    Main constraining factor for choice of this element was power supply.
    Analog power supplied on the board is 3.3V, so the operational amplifier
    must be capable of operating in such condition.
    TLC272C is designed to work with single-supply configuration
    and voltages as low as 3V,
    while providing 2V of undistorted output voltage swing.
\end{itemize}

\section{Schematic}

Schematic was created using KiCad EDA,
which is both cross-platform and open source software.
It provides rich library of components and very intuitive user interface.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/Schematic_connectors}
    \caption{Schamatic of gold pin connectors}
    \label{fig:Schematic3}
\end{figure}

\section{PCB}
PCB layout was prepared using KiCad EDA as well.
All elements except for gold pin headers,
rotary encoder and audio jacks are SMD (surface mounted).
To reduce cost of the project, the PCB was designed as 2 layer board only.
This decision resulted in increased difficulty of routing process.
Gerber files generated by the software were sent to manufacturer in China
and arrived two weeks later.

    \label{fig:photo_boards}
\end{figure}

\section{Assembly}
The PCB was populated by hand using 50W soldering iron and hot air rework station.
Two types of tin-lead solder were used during the process:
0.25mm solder wire (Sn60 Pb40) for THT components and solder paste (Sn62 Pb36 Ag2) for SMD.

\chapter{Internal specification}

\section{Programming environment}
Programming environment consist of several tools,
that need to work together to facilitate software development.
All tools used in this project are cross-platform.
Following section is devoted to choice of these tools.

\subsection{Programming language}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[h]{0.3\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/c_logo}
        \label{fig:c}
    \end{subfigure}
    ~
    \begin{subfigure}[h]{0.3\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/cpp_logo}
        \label{fig:cpp}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{C and C++ languages logos}
    \label{fig:lang}
\end{figure}

C language is the most popular choice for STM32 development.
It is widely supported by ST and other companies providing frameworks and libraries.
As a low level language, it provides control over memory management,
which is a important factor in software development for microcontrollers.

Since the object oriented approach was preferred in this project,
C++ language was chosen.
This allows to benefit from libraries written in C,
but also gives advantages of using classes with inheritance and polymorphism,
which are part of C++ language.

\subsection{IDE}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{images/platformio-logo}
    \caption{PlatformIO IDE logo}
    \label{fig:plaftormio}
\end{figure}

The popular environments for STM32 development are Keil uVision, IAR and SW4STM32.
ST also provides its own STM32CubeIDE, which is based on Eclipse.

Another choice is PlatformIO IDE.
It is free and open source IDE and
comes as a plugin for Visual Studio Code and Atom text editors.
It provides all libraries, frameworks,
debugger server and compiler necessary for STM32 software development.

\subsection{Text editor}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{images/vscode}
    \caption{Visual Studio Code logo}
    \label{fig:vscode}
\end{figure}

Visual Studio Code is a free code editor developed by Microsoft.
It was chosen because it is supported by PlatformIO IDE.
VSCode provides linting and word completion extensions,
which simplify the process of software development.

\subsection{Frameworks and tools}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[h]{0.3\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/cube_logo}

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Logos of SMT32Cube, Arm and the GNU project}
    \label{fig:tools}
\end{figure}

List of frameworks and additional tools used for software development:

\begin{itemize}
    \item HAL drivers
    - Hardware Abstraction Layer driver is a library written in C language, provided by ST.
    It allows an easy use of microcontroller and code compatibility between different STM32 devices.
    \item STM32CubeMX
    - a graphical tool that allows an easy STM32 configuration.
    It generates configuration code for the microcontroller and desired peripherals in C language.
    STM32CubeMX uses HAL driver in generated initialization code.
    \item CMSIS
    - Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard
    is a hardware abstraction layer provided by Arm.
    It is compatible with all Arm Cortex microprocessors and microcontrollers.
    It includes API for Cortex-M and Cortex-A core and peripherals as well as additional tools
    (DSP library, neural network kernels, real-time operating systems).
    \item OpenOCD
    - Open On-Chip Debugger provides programming and debugging support of boundary scan interface.
    It supports ST-Link, which was used for both programming and debugging of STM32 microcontroller.
    \item GNU Embedded Toolchain for Arm
    is a suite of tools for C, C++ and Assembly programming provided and maintained by Arm.
    It contains the GCC Compiler as well as linker.
\end{itemize}

\section{Configuration}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/pin_overview}
    \caption{Screenshot of the pin configuration in STM32CubeMX software}
    \label{fig:pins}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Code generation

    Initialization code was generated using STM32CubeMX software.
    It provided necessery implementation of initialization functions
    as well as general structure of the program.
    Each enabled peripheral has its own source file
    and corresponding header file.

    \item Clock

    Maximum clock frequency for this version of MCU is 400MHz.
    Unfortunately it is not divisible by 48kHz, which is our sampling frequency.
    For that reason clock prescalers are set to obtain 396MHz clock frequency.
    This way it is easy to setup desired sampling frequency on one of the timers.
    Clock was also configured using STM32CubeMX software.

    \item Environmental settings
    
    All settings passed to tools such as linter, compiler and linker
    are present in platformio.ini and extra\_script.py files.
    These settings give information about used frameworks
    and paths to specific libraries and header files.

    \item FPU

    Floating-point unit present in the microcontroller must be enabled
    using special compiler flags. Without them program would be compiled
    using software floating-point, which is very slow and unefficient.
    -mfpu=fpv5-d16 flag specifies version of arm FPU present in microcontroller.
    -mfloat-abi=hard forces to compile with hardware floating-point.
    Both of them are set in extra\_script.py file.

    \item Cache
    
    STM32H7 series of microcontrollers provide both data and instruction cache.
    This kind of memory can enhance performance of the device,
    since it is twice as fast as other sections of RAM.
    Despite the performance gain, cache (especially data cache)
    must be used with caution, since it can cause some issues with DMA.
    The solution involves using cache clear and invalidation functions.
    These function forces transfer between RAM and cache in order to ensue,
    that DMA is referencing valid data.

    \item ADC
    
    ADC is set to continuous conversion mode.
    It is constatnly converting signal with sampling rate above 100kHz.
    Obtained samples are than transfered to a buffer using DMA.
    Parallel to ADC, a timer is generating interrupts
    with rate equal 48kHz. During such interrupt,
    freshest sample is copied into block buffers. 
    When the block buffer is full, it can be swaped with empty buffer
    and than processed.

    \item Timer
    \item SPI
